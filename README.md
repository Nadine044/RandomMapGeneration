# RandomMapGeneration
I am Nadine Gutiérrez Pociño, student of the Bachelor’s Degree in Video Games by UPC at CITM. This content is generated for the second year’s subject Project 2, under supervision of lecturer Ricard Pillosu.

## About the project
This project contains a research about how to generate isometric random maps in C++. There are two map types implemented in the code: dungeon and squared rooms.
